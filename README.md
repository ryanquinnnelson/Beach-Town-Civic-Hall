# Beach-Town-Civic-Hall
My submission for the 2022 design competition at Las Catalinas

## Competition Prompt
"Professionals, Students, and kids alike are invited to present ideas for a civic hall in Beach Town, Las Catalinas! We seek this building to be of architectural importance, embracing the tropical traditional vernacular of Las Catalinas. As a priority, the proposal should optimize natural ventilation. The design should also allow for a building with flexible use, and durable and sustainable materials. This building has many fronts and should provide a welcoming facade on all sides."
